## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm an InfoSec student from Germany with a passion for systems programming, OS and firmware security architecture including Trusted Computing concepts, reverse engineering, offensive security and malware research.  

<hr>

Projects and fields I have previously spent time with include:

### Programming
ğŸŸ¢ Building system-level software in C for Windows (usermode & kernelmode)  
ğŸŸ¢ Building boot applications for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)  
ğŸŸ¢ Creating Anti-RE systems using Code Virtualization concepts      
ğŸŸ¢ Building web frontends using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including various frameworks)  
ğŸŸ¢ Building secure web backends using Rust and PHP   
ğŸŸ¢ Building automation software in various programming languages such as Java and Python  

### Offensive security
ğŸŸ¢ Participating in Capture-The-Flag (CTF) programs such as HackTheBox  
ğŸŸ¢ Performing web hacking in simulated environments  
ğŸŸ¢ Building Red Team offensive software for Windows  
ğŸŸ¢ Implementing multiple proof-of-concepts for kernel mode rootkits and UEFI based bootkits  
ğŸŸ¢ Low-level exploit development  

### Reverse Engineering
ğŸŸ¢ Reverse engineering x86 based binaries and systems using tools such as IDA and Binary Ninja  
ğŸŸ¢ Dynamic reverse engineering using the IDA Debugger, x64dbg and WinDBG  
ğŸŸ¢ Reverse engineering internal mechanisms and modules of the Windows OS  
ğŸŸ¢ Reverse engineering the Windows boot process and its various boot applications  

### Research
ğŸŸ¢ Conducting vulnerability research on Windows and UEFI systems  
ğŸŸ¢ Studying modern boot security and its flaws.  
ğŸŸ¢ Studying Trusted Computing concepts (which I discuss in a more casual setting [here](https://never-unsealed.gitbook.io/blog))  
ğŸŸ¢ Researching modern (hardware based) OS security mechanisms such as Virtualization Based Security (VBS)  
ğŸŸ¢ Writing various scientific papers on the current state of UEFI and kernel mode threats and security measures
