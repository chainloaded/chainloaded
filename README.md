## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an InfoSec student from Germany with a passion for OS and firmware security architecture, reverse engineering, offensive security and malware research. Projects and fields I have previously spent time with include:  

### Programming
-ðŸŸ¢ Building secure system-level software in C for the Windows OS (for both user mode and kernel mode)  
-ðŸŸ¢ Building boot applications in C for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)  
-ðŸŸ¢ Creating anti-reverse-engineering systems using Code-Virtualization concepts  
-ðŸŸ¢ Building web frontends using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including various third-party libraries)  
-ðŸŸ¢ Building secure web backends using PHP and MySQL  
-ðŸŸ¢ Building automation software in various programming languages such as Java and Python  

### Offensive security
-ðŸŸ¢ Participating in various Capture-The-Flag (CTF) programs such as HackTheBox  
-ðŸŸ¢ Performing web hacking in simulated environments  
-ðŸŸ¢ Building Red Team offensive software for the Windows OS  
-ðŸŸ¢ Implementing multiple proof-of-concepts for kernel mode rootkits and UEFI based bootkits  
-ðŸŸ¢ Low-level exploit development  

### Reverse Engineering
-ðŸŸ¢ Reverse engineering x86-based binaries and systems using tools such as IDA and Binary Ninja  
-ðŸŸ¢ Dynamic reverse engineering using the IDA Debugger, x64dbg, and WinDBG  
-ðŸŸ¢ Reverse engineering the internal processes of the Windows OS in both user mode and kernel mode  
-ðŸŸ¢ Reverse engineering the Windows boot process and its various boot applications  

### Research
-ðŸŸ¢ Conducting vulnerability research on Windows and UEFI systems  
-ðŸŸ¢ Studying modern boot security and its flaws, including TPM based security such as SRTM/DRTM based attestation (some of which I discuss in a more casual setting [here](https://never-unsealed.gitbook.io/blog))  
-ðŸŸ¢ Researching modern (hardware based) OS security mechanisms such as Virtualization Based Security (VBS)  
-ðŸŸ¢ Writing various scientific papers on the current state of UEFI and kernel mode threats and security measures
