## Hi there üëã

I'm an graduate InfoSec student from Germany with a passion for systems programming, OS and firmware security architecture, reverse engineering, offensive security and malware research.   

If you'd like to reach out, feel free to add me on Discord (never_unsealed)!  

You might also take a look at my [blog](https://never-unsealed.gitbook.io/blog), where I spontaneously discuss topics such as boot and platform security, and whatever else I find interesting enough! 

<hr>

Some of my past work includes:  

### Programming üíª
‚ö° Coding system-level software for Windows (usermode & kernelmode) using Win32 and native APIs   
‚ö° Coding boot applications for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)  
‚ö° Writing binary obfuscation and virtualization tools  
‚ö° Building web apps with Rust and PHP.  
‚ö° Coding various tools in languages such as Java and Python.  

### Offensive security üü•
‚ö° Participating in CTF programs such as HackTheBox   
‚ö° Building red team oriented software (such as C2s) for Windows  
‚ö° Implementing multiple proof-of-concepts for kernel mode rootkits and UEFI based bootkits  
‚ö° Low-level exploit development  

### Reverse Engineering üëæ
‚ö° Reverse engineering internal mechanisms and modules of the Windows OS  
‚ö° Reverse engineering the Windows boot process and its various boot applications  

### Research ‚úçÔ∏è
‚ö° Conducting vulnerability research on Windows and UEFI systems  
‚ö° Writing various scientific papers on the current state of UEFI and kernel mode threats and security measures  
‚ö° Writing a Bachelor's thesis on the various approaches to code virtualization as a reverse engineering protection
