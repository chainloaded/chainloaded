## Hi there 👋

I'm an InfoSec student from Germany with a passion for systems programming, OS and firmware security architecture, reverse engineering, offensive security and malware research.  
If you'd like to reach out, feel free to add me on Discord (never_unsealed)!

My past projects and focus areas include:

### Programming 💻
🟢 Building system-level software for Windows (usermode & kernelmode)  
🟢 Building boot applications for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)  
🟢 Building anti reverse engineering solutions based on code virtualization    
🟢 Building web front-ends using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including various frameworks)  
🟢 Building secure web back-ends using Rust and PHP   
🟢 Building automation software in various programming languages such as Java and Python  

### Offensive security 🟥
🟢 Participating in Capture-The-Flag (CTF) programs such as HackTheBox  
🟢 Performing web hacking in simulated environments  
🟢 Building Red Team offensive software for Windows  
🟢 Implementing multiple proof-of-concepts for kernel mode rootkits and UEFI based bootkits  
🟢 Low-level exploit development  

### Reverse Engineering 👾
🟢 Reverse engineering x86 based binaries and systems using tools such as IDA and Binary Ninja  
🟢 Dynamic reverse engineering using the IDA Debugger, x64dbg and WinDBG  
🟢 Reverse engineering internal mechanisms and modules of the Windows OS  
🟢 Reverse engineering the Windows boot process and its various boot applications  

### Research ✍️
🟢 Conducting vulnerability research on Windows and UEFI systems  
🟢 Studying modern boot security and its flaws  
🟢 Studying Trusted Computing (which I discuss in a more casual setting [here](https://never-unsealed.gitbook.io/blog))  
🟢 Researching modern (hardware based) OS security mechanisms such as Virtualization Based Security (VBS)  
🟢 Writing various scientific papers on the current state of UEFI and kernel mode threats and security measures  
🟢 Writing a Bachelor's thesis on the various approaches to code virtualization as a reverse engineering protection
