## Hi there 👋

I'm a graduate InfoSec student from Germany with a passion for pretty much anything low-level. My specific interests include vulnerability research and reversee engineering, systems programming and OS and firmware security architecture.

If you'd like to reach out, feel free to add me on Discord (chainloaded)!  

You might also take a look at my [blog](https://chainloaded.gitbook.io/blog), where I spontaneously discuss topics such as boot and platform security, and whatever else I find interesting enough!
